5 steps to create variables:

Step 1:
Amount of memory required to save the values is determined

Step 2:
The program searches for the required amount of memory in RAM

Step 3:
The memory location is reserved

Step 4:
Values are saved in the memory location

Step 5:
Variables are assigned to the memory locations


Types of variables:

1. Value type variables
2. Reference type variables


Types of memory allocations:

1. Static Memory Allocation
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation


Types of Programming Languages:

1. Compiler Based
2. Interpreter Based
